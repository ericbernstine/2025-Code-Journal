UseRef vs UseState

- useState is the better option for quick updates to the DOM, or manipulation in place, pass this event to this listener function
- useRef is better when you want to use traditional DOM manipulation inside react. 
    - This is not the recommended method because it bypassed the virtual DOM and manipulates directly
    - This is also slower with more content?

- Go with useRef when stuck and use more traditional JS DOM API

- In react with useRef remember to use ‘current.syle’ when accessing an element. 

varName.current.style.height = 100px 

name | .current | .style | .cssProperty = value
