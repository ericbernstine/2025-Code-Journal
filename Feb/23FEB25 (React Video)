React Video 

To play video inside a react app, first install the ‘react-player’ via npm.
Then import it

Import ReactPlayer from ‘react-player;

Then treat it like a regular component tag, has different attribute tags than the HTML video tag, but each attribute has similar behavior. 

<ReactPlayer
	url={VideoURLStringVariableHere}
	playing={true}
/>
