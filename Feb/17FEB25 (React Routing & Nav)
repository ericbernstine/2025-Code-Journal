React Routing & Loading 

- React uses SPAs to provide the illusion of navigating through multiple websites. 
- SPAs do not use traditional anchor tags, no page refresh ever occurs, they simply update the DOM in place to reflect new page content.  
- To implement the functionality of MPAs,  the React-Router-DOM, install through node.  
	import {BroswerRouter} from react-router-dom ON PARENT or ROOT (index.js)
	import {Routes, Route, Link} from react-router-dom ON FIRST CHILD, application level (app.js) 
		<Routes>
			<Route path=‘/‘ />
			<Route path="/desired-route-name" element = { < ReactComponentName /> } />
		</Routes>

		<nav>
			<Link to=“/“>First Page</Link>
			<Link to=“/desired-route-name“>Second Page</Link>
		</nav> 
- Webpages can be loaded in two ways, #1: Bundling, used by older websites or static pages, and #2: Lazy loading, or code splitting, when resources are retrieved as needed.
