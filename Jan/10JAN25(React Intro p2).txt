React Intro2 (Props)

- Props in react are basically the same as parameters for standard functions, they are bits of data that is expected to be passed back into the parent component. 
- When using NAMED props they must be wrapped inside {} brackets during deceleration
- You can also avoid naming props and just put props inside the () brackets during component deceleration, then access them using dot notation. 
- IS NOT possible to send data from the child component back to the parent
- When declaring a component using props (Method 1) you can never change the value of those props. For example, 
    - props.title = ‘New Title’ // this is invalid

BOTH ARE VALID SYNTAX

1. function Component (props) {
	return (<h1>{props.title}</h1>)
}

OR

2. function Component ({title}) {
	return (<h1>{title}</h1>)
}
