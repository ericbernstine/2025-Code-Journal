- Try and break it, click every button, search for bugs or unexpected behavior
- Test from a user perspective not a developers

SOFTWARE TESTING 
- Test files will often end in .test or .spec, a file name might look like this. 

app.spec.js
e2e.test.js

- Most test files have a describe feature describing what the component is supposed to do, this is called a test suite and contains multiple tests
- Those individual tests are likely to start with ‘it’
- Most of these test programs will use jest
