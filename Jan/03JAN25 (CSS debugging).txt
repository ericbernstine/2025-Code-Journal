CSS Debugging 

CSS will skip over mistakes it will not log an error message for you. However, it will highlight possible errors. Use Styleinit extension on VS code or use View -> Problems.

Steps: 
- Build mobile first if possible
    - If errors persist on mobile, build responsive components. Meaning set elements or sections to hidden based on the current viewport
- Break down elements to least amount of code possible. 
- Check measurement units of child and parent elements 
- Move items to a different spot and test behavior 
- Download pesticide 
- Account for browser issues (Mostly Safari // Webkit)
    - If errors persist, try resetting the default styling
- USE sites like Modernizer, Reset.css & Normalize.css
- Add a red border to the element
- Inspect pages on Firefox and click the i button for more details on styling issues
- FOR GRID PROBLEMS, open the web app on Firefox and inspect the page, this will show you the exact gridlines
