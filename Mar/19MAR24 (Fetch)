Fetch API 

Javascript by default is single threaded. Fetch, more often than not, because it is awaiting results form an external API and can be skipped over until the results are received. 

It is recommended to place all fetch calls in React inside a useEffect hook to avoid side effects. 

export default function App() { 
  const [btcData, setBtcData] = useState({}); 
  useEffect(() => { 
    fetch(`https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json`) 
      .then((response) => response.json()) 
      .then((jsonData) => setBtcData(jsonData.bpi.USD)) 
      .catch((error) => console.log(error)); 
  }, []);
