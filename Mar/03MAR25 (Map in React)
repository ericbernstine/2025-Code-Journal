Using map in React

- When manipulating 3rd party data, use map()
    - In React, remember that you can imbed HTML elements within the map method. 

Notes about map()
- Map will always return a new array with the same length as the original. 
- If you need items to be removed, make sure to use filter() and not map

You do not need to set an entire new value to add filter onto a map method, since map is returning a value anyways you can place a filter directly on top of it. Like this

Dataset .map((item) => { 
	return item.numbers; 
}) .filter((item) => 
	if(item < 200){
		return true;
});

// KEEP IN MIND
The filter method already returns a true or false value meaning you just place the conditional statement right inside the declaration 
.filter((item) => item < 200);
