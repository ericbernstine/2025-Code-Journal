React useReducer

The useReducer function is a more advanced version of useState dealing with more complex versions of state. For example, where state is dependent on the previous state. 

The useReducer function expects two arguments, the reducer function (this works almost like a switch statement) and the initial state. 

useState vs useReducer 
useState: Best for primitive data types. (Strings, ints, booleans) 
useReducer: Best for complex data types (arrays, and objects)


function reducer(state, action) {
}

function MyComponent() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { age: 42 });
 }
