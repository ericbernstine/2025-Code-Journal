CSS Animation:
- Transform and Transition are used in conjunction with one another. TRANSFORM: to define the animation, i.e., move an object. TRANSITION: defined the rules of the animation i.e., time and style.
- When defining animation and keyframes use this syntax. 

.classDiv { 
  animation: (animation-name) (animation-duration) (animation-style: like 'smooth')
}

@keyframes (animation-name){
  DEFINES ANIMATION RULES
    - Use From & To || Use percentages to give multiple animation points
}

- Apply animation properties such as 'animation-iteration-count', 'animation-delay', 'animation direction', etc, inside the classDiv CSS rules or wherever the animation name is defined.
