React Styling 

- You cannot use class (protected keyword) you instead use className=‘’ 
- Remember to import the CSS file to the JS file where corresponding classes will be applied

INLINE STYLING 
- All inline styling has the same syntax as normal inline CSS, HOWEVER they must be wrapped in {} brackets similar to passing a prop, and must be a value of the style attribute.
            <div>
                <h1 style={{color:"tomato", fontSize:"40px", fontWeight:"bold"}}>
                    {props.heading}
                </h1>
            </div>
- This is called a string literal object, notice how it follows the same syntax as a normal JS object, only passed into the style attribute style={{obj here}}
- That obj being passed into the style attribute can also be defined separately and then passed to the style attribute. style={myObjectName}
		const myStyles = {
			color:"tomato",
			fontSize:"40px"
		}
		<Heading style={myStyles} />
