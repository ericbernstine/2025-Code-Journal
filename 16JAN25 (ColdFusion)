ColdFusion 

- ColdFusion is a markup language similar to html, also uses <> brackets. Originally developed by Adobe 
- ColdFusion seems to be declining in popularity, other server-side languages for websites like Node.js, PHP, python are favored. 
- Used for government systems and legacy applications
- Offers database integration, session management and dynamic updates to web applications. 
- Think of ColdFusion as a PHP alternative, but more distant from HTML
- Almost like an old school framework, but this is an actual language. 
- All of the syntax is the same as other common programming syntax, but uses CF at the start of each tag. 
- Cold fusion components use .cfm files or .cfc (Cold Fusion Markup/ Cold Fusion Component)

<cfif myName EQ "John"> 
	<cfoutput>Hello, John!</cfoutput> 
<cfelse> 
	<cfoutput>Hello, Guest!</cfoutput> 
</cfif>

<cfloop from="1" to="5" index="i"> 
	<cfoutput>#i# </cfoutput> 
</cfloop>

- You can also use a script style syntax that has a standard programming language kind of feel

<cfscript> name = "John"; if (name == "John") { writeOutput("Hello, John!"); } </cfscript>
